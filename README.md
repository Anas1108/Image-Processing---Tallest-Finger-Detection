# Image Processing - Tallest Finger Detection

## Introduction

This repository contains a solution to the problem of detecting the tallest finger in an image of a hand and drawing a circle on its tip. The solution uses computer vision techniques and image processing algorithms to achieve this goal.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code in this repository:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- Numpy

## Usage

The code can be run from the command line by providing the path to the input image as an argument. The output image with the highlighted tallest finger will be saved in the same directory.

python tallest_finger_detection.ipynb --input_image path/to/input_image


## Conclusion

This solution can be used to detect the tallest finger in an image of a hand and draw a circle on its tip. The code can be further improved and optimized to handle more complex scenarios and real-world applications.
